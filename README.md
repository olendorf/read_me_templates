# Template README Files

Readme files are a common way of sharing basic, human readable documentation for a project. While they are often written last, I would encourage everyone to write theirs first and update it as the project progresses. A really nice blog post on this is at [Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)

This repo is still very new, but the plan is to populate it with good templates and examples of READMEs from a variety of projects, disciplines and uses.
