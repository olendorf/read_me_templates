# Template README Files

Readme files are a common way of sharing basic, human readable documentation for a project. While they are often written last, I would encourage everyone to write theirs first and update it as the project progresses. A really nice blog post on this is at [Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html).



This repo is still very new, but the plan is to populate it with good templates and examples of READMEs from a variety of projects, disciplines and uses. If you don't see what you need please feel free to contribute or request.

## Citing

While all the content here is Public Domain to make it really easy to share, please be a good citizen and cite the source and creator of your templates. Where appropriate.

## Contributing
We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

Templates and examples from a variety of domains are especially welcome. They should be in a text format such as text `(.txt)` or markdown `(.md)` but other text based formats are fine too.

1. Fork the repo.

2. Add the content you want.

3. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

**_NOTE:_** All content needs to be under Public Domain (CCO).
