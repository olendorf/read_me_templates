    Post Doc <post@examplec.com> CO-PI, Null State University
    
    
CONTRIBUTORS: List of people who have contributes. (Name, email, role, institution)


PROJECT DATES: Date range for when the project occurred.

SPATIAL EXTENT: Information about any spatial component to the project. Lat/Long is ideal. They can be a bounding box (or polygon) Place names will often work as well.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
    A description of the project associated with the data. What was the goal of the project?
    Briefly describe methods.


DATA DESCRIPTION:

    describe who that can be done.
    
PERSONAL_INFORMATION_ISSUES:
     Describe any personal information that has been removed, and more imporantly any that is included.
     If appropriate include IRB approval number. Include reference to release forms given to participantss

USAGE:
    What software do you need to open and visualize the files? If you are including
    analysis code, what do you need to run that? How would you run it? It might seem
    unneccessary but provide even the most basic instructions.
    
    i.e. These files are standard genomics files that can be opened with any text editor.


FILE MANIFEST or DATA STRUCTURE
    For data sets with just a few files, list the files and briefly describe them.
    
    critter1.bam: Sequence data file from sample critter1. 
    critter2.bam: Sequence data file from sample critter2.
